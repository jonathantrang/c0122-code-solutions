/*
1. Understand
  Given three parameters (firstIndex, secondIndex, and string) return the same string but firstindex and secondindex are swapped
  firstIndex is a number
  secondIndex is a number
2. Clarify
  Will the given numbers ever be bigger that the string itself?
  Strings are immutable
    Can't go straight to swapping
  Turn the string into an array
  Swap the indexes of that array
3. Pseudocode
  Create a function with three parameters (firstIndex, secondIndex, and string)
  Create a for loop that checks the string
